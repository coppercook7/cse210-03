# Jumper
---
Do think you're a lucky one? Play <i>Jumper</i> to try you're luck and use your spelling prowess to figure out the secret word of the puzzle. The rules are simple. You will guess which letters are present in the secret word. If you're guess is wrong, our friend the skydiver will slowly lose his parachute, ultimately sending him to his demise, ending the game. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 jumper
```
If the command python3 doesn't work, try python. 
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Open the jumper folder and select the main module and then click the "run" button.
